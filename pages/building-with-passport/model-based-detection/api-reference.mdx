# API Reference

The Model Based Detection API enables developers to retrieve the [model-based detection scores](https://docs.passport.xyz/building-with-passport/model-based-detection/available-models) that are based on Passport-grade supervised machine learning models, enabling you to score any EVM wallet address without requiring the users to create and build up a Passport score. 

This API is currently in beta. If you need a production-ready API, please use the [Stamp-based Passport API](https://docs.passport.xyz/building-with-passport/passport-api/overview).

You can also experiment with the Model Based Detection API using our [API playground tool](https://api.scorer.gitcoin.co/passport/docs#/Passport%20Analysis/passport_api_get_analysis) and adding your API keys via the 'Authorize' button.

We have launched this endpoint using this base URL: `https://api.scorer.gitcoin.co`
